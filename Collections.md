Scala-specific Collections
==============
(Of course you can still use the collections from the JDK such as ArrayList, HashSet, and simple arrays)

- Scala favors immutable collection (`scala.collection.immutable.`), even though mutable versions are avaliable too (`scala.collection.mutable`).
- If you donâ€™t mention a package name, then, by default, Scala brings on board immutable collections. Because the object Predef (included by default) provides aliases for Set and Map to point to the immutable implementations.
- Immutable collections are thread safe, free from side effects, and help with program correctness.
- The ability to create an object without `new` is because of a special `apply` method, also called a factory method. `Set(1, 2, 4)`

### Set
- `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `BitSet`, `ListSet`
- Set holds an element at most once and it is an unordered collection. 
- Scala optimizes the implementation of Set for smaller values, and creates an implementation of HashSet for values higher than 4.
- merging two Sets by `val mergedFeeds = feeds1 ++ feeds2`
- intersect operation `val commonFeeds = feeds1 & feeds2`
- there are also methods `map`, `filter`, `foreach`, ...

### Map
- `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `ListMap`
- It is a dictionary of key-value pairs.
- To get a feed for a person, simply use the `get` method. The return type of `get` is `Option[T]`.
- To add a feed, use the `updated` method. It has no effect on the original Map.
- There are also methods `filterKey`, `filter`, ...

### List
- Is subclass of `Seq` -> `LinearSeq` -> `List`
- It is an ordered collection of objects
- The most operations on the list are structured around operations on the `head` and `tail`.
- The accesing the second element `val element = list(1)`
- Add element on the begining `val prefixedList = "newElement" :: feeds`
- There are also methods `filter`, `forall`, `exists`, `map`,
- The method `/:` is equivalent to `foldLeft` and `\:` to `foldRight`
- Concatenating `::`

### Seq
- ???

### Methods of Collesctions
- foldLeft - `val sum = array.foldLeft(0) { (sum, elem) => sum + elem }` or with operator `/:`
- foreach - `( 1 to 3 ).foreach( ... )` We used the foreach method of the Range class
- ... Lets read: https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/overview.html

### Tuple
- It is not in `scala.collection.immutable.` package
- Tuple is the collection class in Scala which can hold multiple values with same or different types together.
- It is an immutable object sequence created as comma-separated values. i.e. `(1,2,3)` tuple literal (Tuple3)
- `var (x,y,z) = (1,2,3)` tuple unpacking via pattern matching.
