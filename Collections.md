Scala-specific Collections
==============
(Of course you can still use the collections from the JDK such as ArrayList, HashSet, and simple arrays)

### List

### Set

### Map

### Tuple
- Tuple is the collection class in Scala which can hold multiple values with same or different types together.
- It is an immutable object sequence created as comma-separated values. i.e. `(1,2,3)` tuple literal (Tuple3)
- `var (x,y,z) = (1,2,3)` tuple unpacking via pattern matching.
