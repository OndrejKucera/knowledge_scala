Functional Paradigm
====================

## Functional paradigm
- First functional language was Lisp in 1959
- Restricted: programming without mutable variables, assignments, loops and other imperatives structures (Pure Lisp, XPath)
- Wider sense: focusing on the functions. Functions are first-class citizens. Function can be defined anywhere, function can be passed and returned as a value, functions can be composed by set of operators.
- *Pure function* is without side effects (such as reading files or mutating memory). Pure functions are easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize, and reason about. Furthermore, pure functions are much less prone to bugs.
- *Side effect* means that function does more than just return value. (i.e. i++)
- Why is FP popular: simpler reasoning principles, better modularity, good for parallelism
- Functional programming honors immutability and favors higher-order functions and function composition

## Imperative paradigm
mutable variables, assignments, control structure (ifs, loops, returns, breaks, â€¦) -> von Neumann style (John Backus) -> bottleneck
